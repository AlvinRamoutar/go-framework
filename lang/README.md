# github.com/AlvinRamoutar/go-framework/lang

Language module with a linked relationship to all other `github.com/AlvinRamoutar/go-framework` modules.
Builds a language dictionary per module, per language. 
Each `code` represents a unique string.

Objective is to make this extensible to all modules and projects consuming `github.com/AlvinRamoutar/go-framework` without implementing project-specific strings.
